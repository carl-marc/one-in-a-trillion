# Roadmap
**Last updated:** {{ "2025-06-02" | date: "%d %b %Y" }}

The order of the roadmap, is the order that features are expected to be added to the game.

## UI & UX Simplification
The continuous development of the game has brought many changes to existing features, added functionality, removal of some mechanics & in some cases, added complexity. 

The user experience and interface has been neglected somewhat, making the game a little too hard to navigate and understand easily. Therefore, there will be several incremental updates that try to tackle this, simplify the flows and bring connected features closer together.


## Better Onboarding Experience
Too many players are not finding the 'hook' quick enough.

I am experimenting more & putting the most effort ever into making an onboarding that really helps people understand why they should play this game.


## Mini Games
- Ability to crack new yolks in Cracking
- Spawning whilst tapping, tripply items, daily & 4h prizes
- Level milestones?


## Cracking Simplification & New Features
More details to come


All of the above is subject to change whilst developing and play testing.
