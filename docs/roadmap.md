# Roadmap
**Last updated:** {{ "2025-04-14" | date: "%d %b %Y" }}

The order of the roadmap, is the order that features are expected to be added to the game.

## UI & UX Simplification
The continuous development of the game has brought many changes to existing features, added functionality, removal of some mechanics & in some cases, added complexity. 

The user experience and interface has been neglected somewhat, making the game a little too hard to navigate and understand easily. Therefore, there will be several incremental updates that try to tackle this, simplify the flows and bring connected features closer together.


## Mini game sauce progression
- The **base** luck sauce on mini games will no longer be randomly generated. It will be a value that you permanently increase.
- The **luck sauce** added per 100 blue gems will no longer be a constant value. It will increase as you progress.
- More changes...
