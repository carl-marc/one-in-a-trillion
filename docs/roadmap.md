# Roadmap
**Last updated:** {{ "2025-09-22" | date: "%d %b %Y" }}

The order of the roadmap, is the order that features are expected to be added to the game.


## New Multiplayer Battle Modes
Adding **Day** & **Week** long 1v1 battles!


## Better Onboarding Experience
Too many players are not finding the 'hook' quick enough.

I am experimenting more & putting the most effort ever into making an onboarding that really helps people understand why they should play this game.
