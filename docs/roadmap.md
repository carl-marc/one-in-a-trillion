# Roadmap
**Last updated:** {{ "2025-05-04" | date: "%d %b %Y" }}

The order of the roadmap, is the order that features are expected to be added to the game.

## UI & UX Simplification
The continuous development of the game has brought many changes to existing features, added functionality, removal of some mechanics & in some cases, added complexity. 

The user experience and interface has been neglected somewhat, making the game a little too hard to navigate and understand easily. Therefore, there will be several incremental updates that try to tackle this, simplify the flows and bring connected features closer together.


## Better Onboarding Experience
Too many players are not feeling the 'hook' quick enough.

I am experimenting more & putting the most effort ever into making an onboarding that really helps people understand why they should play this game.


## Mini game sauce progression
Okay so, version v15.0.0 did not work. There's some decent things in there like incubating but in overarching sense, the mini games are less fun than they used to be. 

It's time to remix a bit of the current with the old...

A little something like this:
- Reintroduce currency, in form of new yolks for the mini games
- Simplify adding luck sauce back to just adding the new currency yolks
- At the end of the mini game, you can instacrack the egg (for free) for currency yolks OR you can keep the egg and crack it later for yellow/instant/dubbly/currency yolks at a later point when the egg is boosted
- Mini games start with a base sauce, let's say 1k for a Power - But now, as you play this value increases over time, eventually you'll buy a Power and it's base will be 50m, etc.
- You can buy currency yolks using red gems, the amount you get starts quite low but also increases over time
- The two points above should increase roughly every sessiony, so you feel like you're pushing forward, even just a tiny bit
