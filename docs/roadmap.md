# Roadmap
**Last updated:** {{ "2025-05-14" | date: "%d %b %Y" }}

The order of the roadmap, is the order that features are expected to be added to the game.

## UI & UX Simplification
The continuous development of the game has brought many changes to existing features, added functionality, removal of some mechanics & in some cases, added complexity. 

The user experience and interface has been neglected somewhat, making the game a little too hard to navigate and understand easily. Therefore, there will be several incremental updates that try to tackle this, simplify the flows and bring connected features closer together.


## Better Onboarding Experience
Too many players are not finding the 'hook' quick enough.

I am experimenting more & putting the most effort ever into making an onboarding that really helps people understand why they should play this game.


## Mini game sauce progression
Okay so, version v15.0.0 did not work. There's some decent things in there like incubating but in overarching sense, the mini games are less fun than they used to be. 

It's time to remix a bit of the current with the old...


A little something like this:

Firstly, swap the current phrase of **'luck sauce'** to **Frenzy/Scramble/Power yolks**


- Re-adding currencies
  - Each mini game has it's own **yolk** currency
  - Adding 'luck sauce' is simplified to just adding the **yolk** currency (No red/blue gem + egglopedia + proximity bonuses)
  - At the end of the mini game you are offered a trade to swap the rarest egg for **yolk** currency
  - You can crack eggs to earn more **yolk** currency
  - You can buy **Yolk** currencies for **red gems**
  - **Yolk** currencies are likely to be added to the main game - Tripply items, daily prizes, etc.
- Level progerssion system
  - New Level progress bar which increases with each mini game played
  - Increases by a set amount plus bonuses based on how lucky the mini game was
  - Levelling up gives an permanent upgrade to **base yolks** on a mini game and the cost - **x yolks per 1 red gem**
- Incubating
  - Have to play the mini game when removing from incubator, no more re-incubating eggs several times
 

These changes hope to re-add a better sense of **risk/reward** to playing mini games, help make each one feel at least a little bit progressive & allow really rare pulls to progress you faster. It'll simplifies mini games & integrates the currencies into Cracking, boosted slots & the core loop.


All of this is subject to change whilst developing and play testing.
