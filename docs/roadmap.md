# Roadmap
**Last updated:** {{ "2025-05-04" | date: "%d %b %Y" }}

The order of the roadmap, is the order that features are expected to be added to the game.

## UI & UX Simplification
The continuous development of the game has brought many changes to existing features, added functionality, removal of some mechanics & in some cases, added complexity. 

The user experience and interface has been neglected somewhat, making the game a little too hard to navigate and understand easily. Therefore, there will be several incremental updates that try to tackle this, simplify the flows and bring connected features closer together.


## Better Onboarding Experience
Too many players are not finding the 'hook' quick enough.

I am experimenting more & putting the most effort ever into making an onboarding that really helps people understand why they should play this game.


## Mini game sauce progression
Okay so, version v15.0.0 did not work. There's some decent things in there like incubating but in overarching sense, the mini games are less fun than they used to be. 

It's time to remix a bit of the current with the old...


A little something like this:
- Reintroduce **currency**, in form of new yolks for the mini games.
- **Simplify** adding **luck sauce** back to just adding the new currency yolks.
- At the end of the mini game, you can trade the egg for currency yolks OR you can keep the egg and crack it later for yellow/instant/dubbly/currency yolks, maybe when the egg is boosted.
- Level progerssion system
  - A Level progress bar which increases with each mini game played
  - Increases by a set amount, plus bonuses based on how lucky the mini game was
  - Levelling up gives an upgrade to **base sauce** and **sauce cost**
- You can **buy currency yolks** using red gems, the amount you get starts quite low but also **increases over time**.
- The two points above should increase frequently so that it feels like you are **progressing every session**, even just a little bit.


All of this is subject to change whilst developing and play testing.
