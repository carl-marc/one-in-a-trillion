# v16.0.0 - Multiplayer Rebuild
The infrastructure that powers the Multiplayer has been completely rebuilt from scratch. This will provide opportunities to give better experiences to all players whether you are a casual or highly competitive individual.


## 🔄 Daily Leagues
The daily leagues that we all know so well are getting a big overhaul which will make them easier, more casual and just for fun!

Key changes:

**No More Ratings**

Leagues will no longer change your multiplayer rating and ranks, they become the multiplayer game which is just for fun and prize pots.


**Far Less Matchmaking**

Leagues will feature a much wider mix of ranked players.

As leagues used to match players of similar ranking they nearly always felt difficult to finish in the top 3 and win the big prizes. This change helps give the biggest prizes to the players who are trying most or extremely lucky.


**Auto & Instant Join**

All logged in players will be added to leagues. This will make leagues easier.

There is no longer a 5 minute wait to see your league after entering.


## 🆕 1v1 Battles
A totally new competitive game mode for the players who want to rise up the ratings & try to become the best!

Main features:

**4h Play Time**

Unlike daily leagues, 1v1 battles will last for 4 hours & you can play multiple games per day.


**Matchmaking**

Play against players of a similar rating & beat them to increase your rating & rank.


**Push Notifications**

Receive notifications when a game starts & whenever your opponent overtakes you so you have the best chance of regaining the lead.


**Optional**

If you're not the competitive type then you can simply not play 1v1's, you will still have the chance to win prizes in the daily leagues.

## 🆕 Live Multiplayer Panel
The main game screen will now display a multiplayer panel at the top of the screen giving you live updates on your daily league and 1v1's.

Never feel out the loop, tap on the panel for full game details.

## 📶 Other
- Better data syncing to the servers for a more live experience


## 👋 Team Battle
We will be saying goodbye to the Team Battle for at least a little while. It might be incorporated into the new multiplayer system but the intention is to probably provide a new community competitive experience. Watch this space.


## ⚠️ Rating Reset
With the way we gain/lose rating changing drastically with this update, it only makes sense to reset our ratings.

All players ratings will be set to **600**.

Our ratings history will be deleted - Make sure to screenshot the My Ratings screen before updating if this data is important to you.


## 🚀 Future
As this is a total rebuild of the Multiplayer game, the future is bright.

Possibilities:
- Custom games where you invite friends or post to Community
- Team battles with multiple players per team, such as a 6v6 or a 12v12v12
- Games can last any amount of time, not just 24h and 4h
- Tournaments
