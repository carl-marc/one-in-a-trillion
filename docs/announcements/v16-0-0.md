# v16.0.0
## Multiplayer changes
### Daily Leagues
The daily leagues that we are all so used to are getting a big overhaul which will make them easier, more casual and just for fun!

Key changes:

**No more matchmaking**

Totally random leagues featuring players of all ranks


**No more ratings**

Leagues will no longer change your multiplayer rating and ranks, they are now just for fun & prize pots


**Auto & instant joining**

All logged in players will be added to leagues & there is no longer a 5 minute wait to see your league after entering
