# v16.0.0 - Multiplayer Rebuild
## ðŸ†• Daily Leagues
The daily leagues that we are all so used to are getting a big overhaul which will make them easier, more casual and just for fun!

Key changes:

**No more ratings**

Leagues will no longer change your multiplayer rating and ranks, they become the multiplayer game which is just for fun and prize pots.



**Far less matchmaking**

Leagues will feature a much wider mix of ranked players.

As leagues used to match players of similar ranking they nearly always felt difficult to finish in the top 3 and win the big prizes. 


**Auto & instant joining**

All logged in players will be added to leagues & there is no longer a 5 minute wait to see your league after entering.
