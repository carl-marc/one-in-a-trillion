# v15.4.4 (908)
## Features
- More variations of Incubators released
- Tapping common eggs for the first time now display details in a slide-in overlay rather than the disruptive full screen popup
- First finds in mini games now show a slide-in overlay

## Balancing
- A played mini game has to be more unlucky to offer a buyback

## Bugs
- Wazzle's no longer disappear in Instant Plays
